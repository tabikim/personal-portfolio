Did you encounter any problems in this challenge we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the challenge better?

Problems I encountered were getting some of the images to show up and I believe it had something to do with how I named them; if it was named the same even though they are different things I think the code would get confusing to read and cause it to not show up. I think this challenge could be better with more clear understanding of the csv to json file. It was slightly confusing at first on how to go about it.
